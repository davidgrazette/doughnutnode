      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Is it “doughnuts” or “donuts”? Why can’t it be both? What’s wrong with
        saying things twice? It’s not a studder or a correction, it’s a
        completion. As early as a cook on a ship fried together a doughy mix and
        stabbed them in the middle like a kabab to cool down to the modern day
        sprinkled perfection; doughnuts and donuts have become an American
        staple. For the sake of this technical document, I’ll pick doughnuts.
        And not all doughnuts have holes in the middle. Those are called
        “filled” or “Bismark” doughnuts. And sometimes doughnuts can be the hole
        in the middle. Those are usually called doughnut holes. There are also
        bullseyes/pie doughnuts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The doughnuts with a hole in the middle, must have a name – yes, they do
        – they’re called ring doughnuts. One thing is for sure, doughnuts are
        always fried.
      </p>
      <ul class="indent-one">
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Can I have a Yeast-rise doughnut?”</span>
          <br />
          <br />Yeast-rise doughnut could mean a number of things like ring,
          <br />
          filled or hole. Although they’re different doughnuts, they usually
          <br />

          have to same base. Dairy liquid and an all-purpose flour mix. The
          <br />

          flour usually includes yeast – which is where the “yeast rise” comes
          <br />
          from.
          <br />
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">“I’ll take a Cake doughnut.”</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          Is a vague request. A cake doughnut can also be a number of options
          <br />like the classic Old-Fashion, a simple cake doughnut or even a
          hole <br />doughnut. They usually have to same dairy base as Yeast
          doughnuts <br />with a different type of flour. Cake flour. Yes,
          almost like having a <br />personal pan cake at your disposal. Many
          cake doughnuts also have <br />

          yeast.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This technical document will go over one type of doughnut making; a
        glazed yeast rise doughnut with a dairy base. This document will also be
        mindful of important differences of some processes.

      <p>
        Doughnut eating is risky. With a lot of sugar per serving, each serving
        add up quickly. This means the user must choose wisely. In order to do
        so, the user should know what they’re reaching for peak satisfaction.

      <h2>Doughnuts and Donuts</h2>
      <p>
        Essentially the same thing; they’re not. Doughnuts are usually an
        artisan breakfast dessert where everything is made from scratch.
        Everything; from measuring out and pouring the yeast into the dry mix to
        making the pastry crème or caramel from corn starch and corn syrup.
      </p>
      <p>
        While donuts are typically store bought and premade products that come
        together and give the customer an illusion of a handcrafted product. Or
        a kitchen may be understaffed and overburdened, these ingredients become
        very useful in making an old world, franchise consistency donut.

    <section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
      <h2>Hello World</h2>
      <p>
        To get started making doughnuts one will need to gather all the
        ingredients. Prepare themselves for a lot of lifting. Organize thyself,
        thy movements and space. Memorize, take notes and repeat.
      </p>
      <p>Keep a positive attitude and watch the product upfold.</p>

      <h2>Mixing, Mixer</h2>
      <p>
        Once all the ingredients are organized together, mix appropriately. The
        type of mixer you have will control the order each ingredient is
        combined and amount that is mixed at once. Some kitchens will activate
        the yeast before mixing, the most important key is to stay mindful of
        yeast and salt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Combine all ingredients. Start by adding the liquids first. Then combine
        the dry ingredients. The mixer should start for a short period of time
        in a slow speed mix the dough evenly. After the slow mix, allow the
        dough to sit briefly. Once combined increase the speed and time of
        mixer. This will fully combine the dough. The dough will remind you that
        it is fully combined by popping. Air bubbles will start forming and the
        mixer paddle will slip through the dough. Allow dough to sit again.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="proofing">
      <h2>Proofing</h2>
      <p>
        Cutting and scaling allows you to prepare doughnuts to proof evenly.
        This will be the first step of proofing. Your mixer will be full of
        dough that is ready to start expanding on it’s own. Quickly cut and
        evenly measure out your dough in the bins and put the lids on.
      </p>
      <p>
        This proofing process should take four to five hours. When the dough
        expands and begins pushing the lid of your bins open, they’re ready.
        Knead dough in even bin and allow dough to expand once more.
      </p>
      <p>The dough is ready to be rolled and cut.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="rolling_and_cutting">
      <h2>Rolling and Cutting</h2>
      <p>
        Not every kitchen uses rollers. Some kitchens roll their dough with
        machines. Each bin has a slab of dough that has proofed twice now. Roll
        each slab out with a roller. The slabs should be evenly rolled in the
        process of giving the doughnuts consistency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once rolled, cut rolled dough evenly to yield the most amount of
        doughnuts per stab. A biscuit cutter will give the doughnut its first
        cut. A second cut will need to be had in the middle of the doughnut to
        give it its ring shape. Doughnut holes can be used with the scrap dough
        this will leave. Skip this step if you are making Bismark doughnuts.
        Evenly place each doughnut on sheet trays.
      </p>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="proofer">
      <h2>Proofer</h2>
      <p>
        Set proofer to 34% humidity and a temperature of 100 degrees. Place each
        sheet try in your proofer and allow to sit for an hour. Doughnuts will
        rise and take shape. Flour will also begin to show prominence on each
        doughnut. The Bismark doughnuts may take longer. Poking the Bismark with
        a fork will show that it is sturdy and show the doughnut ready to be
        fried.

    <section class="main-section" id="glaze">
      <h2>Glaze</h2>
      <p>
        What type of doughnut are you making? Glazed? Frosted? Some kitchens
        will call everything glaze, yet the final product may not reflect such.
        The glaze should be ready and prepared before frying.
      </p>
      <p>
        The glaze is not easy. Be mindful of the paddle. First, add
        confectioners’ sugar. Then add the vanilla paste to the confectioners’
        sugar. Begin slowly mixing confectioners’ sugar. Mix the milk and
        vanilla extract together and slowly pour milk mixture to sugar. Once
        together, turn up mixer speed for 10 minutes. Add glaze to bin and
        store.

    <section class="main-section" id="fryer">
      <h2>Fryer</h2>
      <p>
        The fryer should be ready for doughnuts to be dropped. 350 to 400
        degrees is a good starting point. The can either be industry size or a
        pot on a heating pad. The most important part of frying is keeping the
        heat of the oil consistent to yield consistency in each doughnut.
      </p>
      <p>
        Doughnuts cook fast. Once dropped, the doughnut will dip into oil and
        float back to the top. If doughnut sinks to the bottom check baking
        powder and baking soda. Fry time will take less than 2 minutes to cook
        on one side. Flip doughnuts fast to once again yield consistency. Remove
        all doughnuts as close to the same time as humanly possible. This will
        once again yield consistency.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="glazing">
      <h2>Glazing</h2>
      <p>
        The doughnut should be warm when it comes in contact with the glaze to
        yield a thin layer of glaze over the doughnut. Repeat process until
        desired amount of doughnuts are glazed.

      <p>
        Making doughnuts is just that – making doughnuts. Making doughnuts is
        not baking. Making doughnuts is also not fry cooking. Making doughnuts
        it is it’s own craft. Making doughnuts is making doughnuts.
